# My Auth Project

This project implements a simple authentication system with registration, login, and logout functionalities. It is built using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. Users can register with their email, log in, and log out securely. Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend, and Navigate is used for page navigation after successful login or registration.
